OS Coord: A Simple OS Coordinate Transformation Library for C
=============================================================

This library is a C-language port of [Chris Veness' Ordinance Survey coordinate
conversion library in
Javascript](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-gridref.html). For
further information on conversion between GPS and OS coordinates (and to find
out why this statement would be considered extremely vague) see the excellent
OS-published guide [A guide to coordinate systems in Great
Britain](http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/coordinates/OSGB.pdf).
